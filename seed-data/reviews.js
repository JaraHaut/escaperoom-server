      "Beautiful and nice location, the flat has some mold issues that are difficult to repair. The letting agent takes a lot of time to fix or repair anything in the flat and when it does, always the cheapest useless solution. It is a really small overpriced flat, old and not very well maintained. During the 2 years we rented this flat they didn't raise the price, which is nice, but they tried to take advantage of our deposit and we had to complain with photos and evidence to prove we didn't damage anything. We won't repeat with the same letting agent.",

      "Furniture was well-maintained and comfortable. Excellent thermal insulation and noise reduction. Management was top-notch, addressing concerns promptly. The area is safe and has excellent connectivity. They asked to raise the price more than 20% after the first year so we decided to leave.",

      "The furniture was in poor condition, needing immediate attention. Comfort was compromised due to poor thermal insulation and noise issues. Management was lacking; maintenance requests were often ignored. Safety and connectivity were average. The letting agent tried to scam us with the deposit, we got it back after 3 months.",

      "The property was unfurnished but the finishes were in great condition. The property had excellent thermal insulation and noise reduction. The heating failed a couple of times in winter but itwas fixed quickly. The landlord's management was attentive and quick to address any issues. The area is safe and offers great connectivity.",

      "Furniture was well-kept and added to the overall comfort. Thermal insulation was good, and noise insulation was satisfactory despite the near location of a tube station. There was a leak from the flat upstairs that damaged our ceiling but it was solved. The landlord's management was excellent. The area is not very safe, I was scared to walk alone at night.",

Management was average; responses were delayed at times. The area feels safe but lacks good connectivity. They never raised the rent in 3 years, there was a good relationship between us, the tenants, and the landlord.",
